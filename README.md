# Weather Dashboard

## Description

My motivation on building this webpage was to use the skills we learned this week in class, and create a weather dashboard using Javascript. The reason building this webpage was to allow users visit, and be able to search whichever city they are wanting to know the weather to, and give a current weather update along with a 5-day forecast. A few things I've learned creating this webpage was utilizing the OpenWeather API, parsing the information that I needed including the city, the temperature, humidity, windspeed, and even an icon representing the weather for that day. I also used past things that I've learned like saving to the local storage, using innerHTML to include it in the HTML once it's needed, and using the for loop to implement the buttons to display the search history from the local storage.

## Usage

This webpage was created to allow users to visit and be able to type in any city and get them the current weather, and a 5-day forecast. To utilize the webpage, simply type in any city you'd like the weather report for in the "Enter a city name" search box and click search. It will give you the current weather data in the main box in the center of the page, along with a 5-day forecast. If you see on the left side of the page, under the search box, all your previous search cities will display giving you the option to click them again and get the weather report for you.
